#TODO 2. Create a list of the phonetic code words from a word that the user inputs.

# asks the user what word to spell out, and then iterates through that word. When doing a
# loop through a single word, it iterates through each individual letter. So this one
# iterates through each letter, and then checks for that letter in the dictionary. If it
# finds that letter in the dictionary, it takes the value associated with that letter and
# puts it into the list. It loops through until finishing the word (and thus the new list)
